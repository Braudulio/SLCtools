This tool generates the four key variables required to perform the surface elements classification: slope, ruggedness (vrm), finescale and broadscale bathymetric position index (BPI).
</p>
<p>Slope calculates the gradient change of the surface in degrees. Slope is calculated using the <b>QGIS GDAL 'Slope'</b> tool (GDAL/OGR Contributors, 2025).
</p>
<p>Ruggedness (vrm) calculates the variation of a surface as a representation of roughness, with output values ranging from 0 (no variation) to 1 (complete variation). Ruggedness is calculated using the <b>SAGA 'Vector Ruggedness Measure (VRM)'</b> tool (Conrad et al., 2015) and uses a 'square' search mode with radius 1.
</p>
<p>Bathymetric Position Index (BPI) calculates relative elevation across a seascape, where large positive values represent higher elevation areas of the dataset, large negative values represent area of lower elevation, and values around zero represent flatter areas. BPI is calculated using the methodology from the Geomorphometry and Gradient Metrics v2.0 toolbox <b>'Slope Position'</b> tool (Evans et al. 2014) and the <b>WhiteBox Tools 'Median Filter'</b> tool (Lindsay, 2016). BPI grids are calculated at user-defined broad and fine scales. Broadscale BPI uses a higher value for the window size, while finescale BPI uses a lower value for the window size.
</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold">Default values for the BPI window sizes are based on a 5 m DEM (with no smoothing performed) and are intended as a guide.
</p>
<p>This tool is intended for users to explore the terrain variables and determine suitable threshold settings.
</p>

<h2>Input parameters</h2>
<h3>DEM</h3>
<p>Input raster dataset (DEM) as a GeoTIFF.</p>

<h3>Region Label</h3>
<p>Name for output directory (TERRAIN_[<em>Region Label</em>]) that results will be transfered to <em>i.e. test</em>, that is created if necessary. All transfered results are also renamed with this label as a prefix <em>i.e. test_slope.tif</em>.
</p>

<h3>BroadBPI Window Size</h3>
<p>This variable specifies the window size (distance in cells) that is used to calculate broadscale BPI.
</p>
<p style="font-style:italic;">For example, a threshold of 150 cells will use a 150 cell-radius (750 m for a 5 m cell DEM) from an individual cell to calculate relative elevation. This 150-cell window will be run across the entire dataset to calculate the relative high, flat and low areas of the dataset at a broad scale.
</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold;">Default values for the BPI window sizes are based on a 5 m (with no smoothing performed) and are intended as a guide.
</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold;">Individual datasets should be interrogated to determine the most suitable threshold settings.
</p>
<h3>FineBPI Window Size</h3>
<p>This variable specifies the window size (distance in cells) that is used to calculate finescale BPI.
</p>
<p style="font-style:italic;">For example, a threshold of 27 cells will use a 27 cell-radius (135 m for a 5 m cell DEM) from an individual cell to calculate relative elevation. This 27-cell window will be run across the entire dataset to calculate the relative high, flat and low areas of the dataset at a broad scale.
</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold;">Default values for the BPI window sizes are based on a 5 m (with no smoothing performed) and are intended as a guide.
</p>
<p>Individual datasets should be interrogated to determine the most suitable threshold settings.
</p>
<h2>Outputs</h2>
<p>Outputs GeoTIFF rasters to <em>../Working/</em> for slope, vrm, broadbpi and finebpi which are subsequently renamed and transfered to the TERRAIN_[<em>Region Label</em>] directory.

The surface elements classification breaks up the surface into key components based on ruggedness, slope, finescale and broadscale bathymetric position index (BPI). The user is required to enter classification thresholds for each variable, which forms the resultant surface elements. The approach has been developed to target shelf reef features, which are captured effectively by the ruggedness (VRM) variable.
</p>
<p>The default settings have been determined based on a 5 m cell size raster, with no smoothing performed. Settings should be modified by the user based on the resolution and features of interest within each dataset (see Table 1). The settings applied are recorded as a text file prefixed with 'Current Session'.
</p>
<p style="font-style:italic;">Tip: Users may explore different threshold settings by classifying the symbology within the layer's properties.
</p>

<p>The surface elements classification characterises the surface into 11 detailed classes of surface texture, which may combine one or two reclassified terrain variables. For example, 'Broadscale high Rugose' surface element class combines the user-defined 'high' broadscale BPI class and 'rugose' ruggedness class. The 'surface element' labels are defined in the output 'SURF_EL' field.
</p>

<p>The 11 'surface element' classes are then aggregated into 7 classes to create a 'summarised surface elements' layer, which offers a simplified layer for users to interpret features. For example, the 'Broadscale high Rugose' would be aggregated with other rugose 'high' classes to form 'Rugose outcrops'. The 'summarised surface element' labels are defined in the output 'SUM_SE' field.
</p>

<p>The results of the tool are renamed and transferred to the SURFEL_[<em>Region Label</em>] directory.

<h2>Input parameters</h2>
<h3>DEM</h3>
<p>Input raster dataset (DEM) as a GeoTIFF</p>

<h3>Region Label</h3>
<p>Name for output directory (SURFEL_[<em>Region Label</em>]) that results will be transfered to <em>i.e. test</em>, that is created if necessary. All transfered results are also renamed with this label as a prefix <em>i.e. test_surf_elem.shp</em>.
</p>

<h3>Slope Threshold</h3>
<p>Slope calculates the gradient change of the surface in degrees.
</p>
<p>Slope is calculated using the <b>QGIS GDAL 'Slope'</b> tool (GDAL/ORG Contributors, 2025).
</p>
<p>User-defined thresholds will reclassify the data into 'slope' (higher slope) classes. The extent of higher slope areas will be carried through to the surface elements classification as 'Slope' classes. These classes will ultimately be defined as 'Scarps' in the landform classification.

<p style="font-style:italic;">For example, a slope threshold of 10 degrees will reclassify: 1) all values &ge; 10 as 'slope' surface element classes; and 2) all values < 10 degrees as lower slope areas, not defined in the surface elements and landform classifications. All values < 10 degrees are instead defined by other surface element classes (ruggedness, finescale BPI, broadscale BPI).
</p>

<p style="font-weight:bold;">Default values are based on a 5 m DEM (with no smoothing performed) and are intended as a guide.
</p>

<p>Individual datasets should be interrogated to determine the most suitable threshold settings.

</figure>
</center>

<h3>Ruggedness Threshold</h3>
<p>Ruggedness (vrm) calculates the variation of a surface as a representation of roughness, with output values ranging from 0 (no variation) to 1 (complete variation).
</p>
<p>Ruggedness is calculated using the SAGA 'Vector Ruggedness Measure (VRM)' tool (Conrad et al., 2015) and uses a 'square' search mode with radius 1.
</p>
<p>A user-defined threshold will reclassify the data into 'rugose' (higher ruggedness) and 'smooth' (lower ruggedness) classes. The extent of rugose outcrops defined will be carried through to the surface elements classification as 'Rugose' classes and, for example, may become a 'Reefs/Banks' class in the landform classification. Areas below the selected ruggedness value for rugose features will be carried through as 'Smooth' classes in the surface elements classification and, for example, may become a 'Plain' class in the landform classification.
</p>

<p style="font-style:italic;">For example, a ruggedness threshold of 0.0002 will reclassify: 1) all values &ge; 0.0002 as 'rugose' surface element classes; and 2) values < 0.0002 as 'smooth' surface element classes.
</p>

<p style="font-weight:bold;">Default values are based on a 5 m DEM smoothed (with no smoothing performed) and are intended as a guide. Ruggedness threshold values should be adjusted according to input DEM resolution and smoothing iterations (if applied). See Table 1 for examples.
</p>

<p>Individual datasets should be interrogated to determine the most suitable threshold settings.
</p>

<p style="font-style:italic;">Tip: When determining the ruggedness threshold, it is important to note that subsequent steps in the classification methodology will identify polygons within a rugose outcrop. If the rugose outcrop edge is adequately captured by the ruggedness threshold, 'gaps' within the outcrop will be identified in later steps as polygons within the outcrop surface. To select a suitable ruggedness threshold, the extent of rugose outcrops captured needs to be balanced with the amount of noise captured, and in turn, manual editing required. Noise correction steps applied in later steps of the landform classification reduce noise within the dataset. See the 'preliminary landforms' section for further information on the noise correction procedure.

</figure>
</center>

<h3>BroadBPI Thresholds</h3>
<p>Bathymetric Position Index (BPI) calculates relative elevation across a seascape, where large positive values represent higher elevation areas of the dataset, large negative values represent area of lower elevation, and values around zero represent flatter areas.
</p>

<p>BPI is calculated using the methodology from the Geomorphometry and Gradient Metrics v2.0 toolbox 'Slope Position' tool (Evans et al., 2014) and the WhiteBox Tools 'Median Filter' tool (Lindsay, 2016).
</p>

<p>Two user-defined thresholds will reclassify the data into 'broadscale low' (negative BPI values), 'flat' (BPI values around zero), and 'broadscale high' (positive BPI values) classes.
</p>

<p>The upper limit of broadscale BPI, will create 'Broadscale High' classes within the surface elements classification, and the lower BPI limit of broadscale BPI, will create 'Broadscale Low' classes. The values in between will be defined as 'Flat' areas. 'Broadscale High' surface elements, for example, may become 'Peak' classes in the landform classification, and 'Broadscale Low' classes, for example, may become 'Depressions and channels' in the landform classification.
</p>

<p style="font-style:italic;">For example, a threshold of -100; 100 will create a reclassified polygon separated into three classes: 1) the lower extent of data values (dataset-dependent) to -100. These larger, negative BPI values as classed as 'broadscale low'; 2) -100 to 100. These data values around zero are classed as 'flat'; 3) 100 to the upper extent of data values (dataset-dependent). These larger, positive BPI values are classed as 'broadscale high'.
</p>

<p style="font-weight:bold;">Default values are based on a broadscale BPI window size of 150 cells with 5 m DEM (with no smoothing performed) and are intended as a guide.
</p>

<p>Individual datasets should be interrogated to determine the most suitable threshold settings.
</p>

</figure>
</center>

<h3>BroadBPI Window Size</h3>
<p>This variable specifies the window size (distance in cells) that is used to calculate broadscale BPI.
</p>
<p style="font-style:italic;">For example, a threshold of 150 cells will use a 150 cell-radius (750 m for a 5 m cell DEM) from an individual cell to calculate relative elevation. This 150-cell window will be run across the entire dataset to calculate the relative high, flat and low areas of the dataset at a broad scale.
</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold;">Default values are based on a broadscale BPI window size of 150 cells with 5 m DEM (with no smoothing performed) and are intended as a guide.
</p>
<p>Individual datasets should be interrogated to determine the most suitable threshold settings.
</p>

<h3>FineBPI Thresholds</h3>
<p>Bathymetric Position Index (BPI) calculates relative elevation across a seascape, where large positive values represent higher elevation areas of the dataset, large negative values represent areas of lower elevation, and values around zero represent flatter areas.
</p>

<p>BPI is calculated using the methodology from the Geomorphometry and Gradient Metrics v2.0 toolbox 'Slope Position' tool (Evans et al., 2014) and the WhiteBox Tools 'Median Filter' tool (Lindsay, 2016).
</p>

<p>The upper limit of finescale BPI, will create 'Finescale High' classes within the surface elements classification, and the lower BPI limit of finescale BPI, will create 'Finescale Low' classes. The values in between will be defined as 'Flat' areas. 'Finescale High' surface elements, for example, may become 'Peak' classes in the landform classification, and 'Finescale Low' classes, for example, may become 'Depressions and channels' in the landform classification.
</p>
<p style="font-style:italic;">For example, a threshold of -100; 100 will create a reclassified polygon separated into three classes: 1) the lower extent of data values (dataset-dependent) to -100. These larger, negative BPI values as classed as 'finescale low'; 2) -100 to 100. These data values around zero are classed as 'flat'; 3) 100 to the upper extent of data values (dataset-dependent). These larger, positive BPI values are classed as 'finescale high'.
</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold;">Default values are based on a finescale BPI window size of 27 cells with 5 m DEM (with no smoothing performed) and are intended as a guide.
</p>
<p>Individual datasets should be interrogated to determine the most suitable threshold settings.

</center>

<h3>FineBPI Window Size</h3>
<p>This variable specifies the window size (distance in cells) that is used to calculate finescale BPI.
</p>
<p style="font-style:italic;">For example, a threshold of 27 cells will use a 27 cell-radius (135 m for a 5 m cell DEM) from an individual cell to calculate relative elevation. This 27-cell window will be run across the entire dataset to calculate the relative high, flat and low areas of the dataset at a broad scale.

<h2>Outputs</h2>
<h3>Surface Elements</h3>
<p>A shapefile (surf_elem.shp) containing the surface elements classification is created in <em>../Working/</em> and subsequently renamed and transfered to the SURFEL_[<em>Region Label</em>] directory.
</p>

<h3>Auxillary Outputs</h3>
<p>Also outputs GeoTIFF rasters to <em>../Working/</em> for slope, vrm, broadbpi and finebpi. These are then renamed and transfered to the SURFEL_[<em>Region Label</em>] directory along with their reclassified shapefiles.

Seabed landforms are defined from the classified surface elements, where multiple surface element classes may be ultimately grouped to form a landform. Landforms represent key features of the seascape, including 'reefs/banks', 'peaks', 'plains', 'scarps', 'depressions and channels'. These classes do not represent the only landforms that may occur within a seascape and are intended to capture the prominent features observed within a continental or island shelf setting.
</p>
<p>The user is required to input the 'surface elements' created in LANDFORMS 02 and the associated DEM. A user-defined ruggedness threshold is required which will be used to identify potential 'noise' polygons.
</p>
<p>This tool first defines preliminary landforms. The user is required to review and edit these classes before proceeding to finalise the classification.
</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold;">All classes should be reviewed, however specific classes are flagged with a 'REVIEW' label where they may fall into one of two categories. For example, 'Depressions and channels Rugose REVIEW' may be 'Depressions and channels Rugose' or 'Reefs/Banks'.
</p>

<p style="font-style:italic;">Tip: It is recommended the user display the slope grid transparently (e.g. 50%) over the preliminary landforms classification. The input DEM should also be loaded for interrogation.

<p style=" margin-top:0px;">* Indicates the final landform class that is attributed without manual editing for "REVIEW" polygons.
</p>
</center>

<p>The 'prelim_landforms' feature class is the preliminary landforms classification output which requires manual review and potential editing by the user. Preliminary landform labels are attributed within the field "PrelimLand". These include: Peaks, Peaks REVIEW, Reefs/Banks, Reefs/Banks REVIEW, Scarps, Depressions and channels Smooth, Depressions and Channels Rugose, Depressions and Channels Rugose REVIEW, and Plains. 'Rugose' and 'Smooth' qualifiers are provided for the depressions and channels. 'Rugose' depressions and channels are considered part of the outcropping reef/bank surface, whereas 'Smooth' depressions and channels are contained by, rather than a part of the outcropping reef/bank surface. Note: the 'LAND_2' field is a duplicate of 'PrelimLand' in case the user needs to refer back to the original labels when performing edits.
</p>
<p>The landform classification approach is flexible to the user's specific terminology of features and users can add landform terms. The toolset provides classified boundaries which can be reviewed and altered by the user to create the final classification. Any new or altered terms applied during the editing of the preliminary landforms layer will be carried across as final landform labels.
</p>
<p style="font-style:italic;">Tip: If new landform labels are defined, these will not be visible in the default Symbology associated with the shapefile.

</figure>
</center>

<h4>Required edits:</h4>
<p>Several classes are labelled with a "REVIEW" suffix, including "Depressions and channels Rugose REVIEW" and "Reefs/Banks REVIEW". They occur when a class may fall into one of two classes (see Table 2). The most likely class is assigned, however visual inspection is required to confirm or relabel the polygon into the appropriate class.
</p>
<p>During the procedure to define preliminary landforms, 'noise' polygons are identified in areas where rugose polygons do not overlap with higher ruggedness areas. These polygons require review and potential editing by the user to ensure the full extent of the observed features are captured. The original landform terms are captured within the 'LAND_1' field, and the 'LAND_2' labels can be updated by carrying across these original ('LAND_1') labels as required.
</p>

<h4>Optional edits: </h4>
<p>The output of the landforms classification creates an aggregated category of "reefs/banks". 'Reefs' represent inferred rock or biogenic reef features, and 'banks' are inferred as soft-sediment features (Table 3). While the landform classification is not intended to map substrates, rock/biogenic reef and soft sediment outcrops can be discernible to users familiar with the seascape (as occurs where features are manually digitised), and in such cases they can be considered distinct landforms. While these features are not separated automatically through the toolbox, users can manually edit the output to separate these features, if desired. This flexibility allows users to adjust the landform output to meet their requirements.
</p>
<p>Additional 'Rugose' channel features are captured by the 'Depressions and channels Rugose REVIEW' class. These features can be reviewed and manually edited to be included in the final landform classification if the user desires greater detail of variation across the reef/bank surface. This class can include the reef/bank edge as a rugose 'low' depression/channel. Therefore, to separate the additional rugose channels, the user must manually edit and cut the channel extent from the 'Depressions and channels Rugose REVIEW' polygon. If this editing is not performed, the 'Depressions and channels Rugose REVIEW' classes will be labelled as 'Reefs/Banks' in the subsequent step to finalise landforms. An example of these optional edits are included in Figure 8.

<h2>Input parameters</h2>
<h3>Surface Elements (shapefile)</h3>
<p>Surface elements shapefile, usually generated by the <a href="#land02">LANDFORMS 02 surface elements</a> tool.

<h3>DEM</h3>
<p>Input raster dataset (DEM) as a GeoTIFF</p>

<h3>Region Label</h3>
<p>Name for output directory (PRELIM_[<em>Region Label</em>]) that results will be transfered to <em>i.e. test</em>, that is created if necessary. All transfered results are also renamed with this label as a prefix <em>i.e. test_prelim_landforms.shp</em>.
</p>

<h3>Ruggedness Threshold</h3>
<p>A user-defined 'noise' ruggedness threshold is used to identify potential noise polygons in the data.
Noise may be erroneous data sourced from the input bathymetry (such as speckled noise in marine lidar data or imagery), or superfluous rugose outcrops. To correct for these additional 'noise' areas, a 'noise ruggedness threshold' is used to identify areas of higher ruggedness, which are inferred areas of greater relief and therefore less likely to be noise in the data.
</p>
<p>With a user-defined 'noise' ruggedness threshold, processes are implemented to overlap the ‘ruggedness noise threshold’ (higher ruggedness value, e.g. 0.001) with the rugose outcrops defined in the surface elements classification (lower ruggedness value, e.g. 0.0002). Where rugose outcrops overlap with the ruggedness noise threshold, the preliminary landform labels are retained. Where they do not overlap, the polygons are labelled as 'noise'. These 'noise' polygons are to be manually reviewed by the user in later steps to ensure polygons are correctly attributed.
</p>
<p>A suitable 'noise' ruggedness threshold can be identified by interrogating the ruggedness layer, and selecting a value which, when overlapped with the ruggedness threshold for rugose outcrops, will retain the most appropriate extent of the rugose outcrop. An example is provided below in Figure 7.
</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold;">Default values are based on a 5 m DEM (with no smoothing performed) and are intended as a guide.
</p>
<p>Individual datasets should be interrogated to determine the most suitable threshold settings.

Plain landforms are defined using finescale and broadscale BPI, creating classes including Plain High, Plain Low, Localised high, Localised low and Plain flat. This classification intends to capture additional detail across the plain area for users focused on the inferred sedimentary environment.
</p>
<p>Where an existing 'Plains DEM' doesn't exist, a plains DEM is extracted from the original DEM using the plain features classified in the final landforms layer from <a href="#land04">LANDFORMS 04 final landforms</a>.
</p>
<p>The user-defined BPI thresholds and window sizes will reclassify the data into 5 plain landform classes: 'localised low', 'localised high', 'plain low', 'plain flat' and 'plain high'.
</p>
<p>This tool has optional functionality to eliminate small polygons, with a user-defined polygon area.
</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold">Default values are based on a 5 m DEM (witn no smoothing performed) and are intended as a guide.

<p>Individual datasets should be interrogated to determine the most suitable threshold settings.
</p>
<p>The results of the tool are renamed and transfered to the directory PLAIN_[<em>Region Label</em>].
</p>

<h2>Input parameters</h2>
<h3>DEM</h3>
<p>Input raster dataset (DEM) as a GeoTIFF. This can be a 'Plains DEM', <em>i.e.</em> with only areas corresponding to 'plains' features, or the entire DEM that then has the area corresponding to 'plains' features (defined in the 'LANDFORMS' field) extracted using the <em>Final Landforms</em> polygon.</p>

<h3>Final Landforms [Optional]</h3>
<p>A shapefile containing the classified final landforms generated by <a href="#land04">LANDFORMS 04 final landforms</a> to be used to extract areas corresponding to 'plains' classification and used as the 'Plains DEM'. If this value is left blank the tool assumes the input <em>DEM</em> is a 'Plains DEM'.
</p>

<h3>Region Label</h3>
<p>Name for output directory (PLAIN_[Region Label]) that results will be transferred to <em>i.e. test</em>, that is created if necessary. All transferred results are also renamed with this label as a prefix <em>i.e. test_surf_elem_plain.shp</em>.
</p>

<h3>BroadBPI Thresholds</h3>
<p>Bathymetric Position Index (BPI) calculates relative elevation across a seascape, where large positive values represent higher elevation areas of the dataset, large negative values represent area of lower elevation, and values around zero represent flatter areas.
</p>
<p>
BPI is calculated using the methodology from the 'Slope Position' tool in the Geomorphometry and Gradient Metrics v2.0 toolbox (Evans et al., 2014).
</p>

<p>Here, the user will select two values to define an upper limit of broadscale BPI, which will create 'Broadscale High' classes within the plain surface elements classification, and a lower BPI limit of broadscale BPI, which will create 'Broadscale Low' classes. The values in between will be defined as 'Plane' areas. 'Broadscale High' plain surface elements will become 'Broadscale high' classes in the plain landform classification, and 'Broadscale Low' classes will become Broadscale low' classes in the landform classification. 'Plane' areas will form part of the 'Plain flat' classes in the plain landforms classification.
</p>

<p style="font-style:italic;">For example, a threshold of -60; 60 will create a reclassified polygon separated into three classes: 1) the lower extent of data values (dataset-dependent) to -60. These larger, negative BPI values as classed as 'broadscale low'; 2) -60 to 60. These data values around zero are classed as 'plane'; 3) 60 to the upper extent of data values (dataset-dependent). These larger, positive BPI values are classed as 'broadscale high'.
</p>

<p style="font-weight:bold;">Default values are based on a broadscale BPI window size of 150 cells with 5 m DEM (with no smoothing performed) and are intended as a guide.
</p>

<p>Individual datasets should be interrogated to determine the most suitable threshold settings.
</p>

<h3>BroadBPI Window Size</h3>
<p>This variable specifies the window size (distance in cells) that is used to calculate broadscale BPI.
</p>
<p style="font-style:italic;">For example, a threshold of 150 cells will use a 150 cell-radius (750 m for a 5 m cell DEM) from an individual cell to calculate relative elevation. This 150-cell window will be run across the entire dataset to calculate the relative high, flat and low areas of the dataset at a broad scale.
</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold;">Default values are based on a 5 m DEM (with no smoothing performed) and are intended as a guide.
</p>
<p>Individual datasets should be interrogated to determine the most suitable threshold settings.
</p>

<h3>FineBPI Thresholds</h3>
<p>Bathymetric Position Index (BPI) calculates relative elevation across a seascape, where large positive values represent higher elevation areas of the dataset, large negative values represent areas of lower elevation, and values around zero represent flatter areas.
</p>
<p>BPI is calculated using the methodology from the 'Slope Position' tool in the Geomorphometry and Gradient Metrics v2.0 toolbox (Evans et al. 2014)
</p>
<p>Here, the user will select two values to define an upper limit of finescale BPI, which will create 'Finescale High' classes within the plain surface elements classification, and a lower BPI limit of finescale BPI, which will create 'Finescale Low' classes. The values in between will be defined as 'Plane' areas. 'Finescale High' surface elements, for example, will become 'Localised high' classes in the plain landform classification, and 'Finescale Low' classes, for example, will become 'Localised low' in the landform classification. 'Plane' areas will form part of the 'Plain flat' class in the plain landforms classification.
</p>
<p style="font-style:italic;">For example, a threshold of -60; 60 will create a reclassified polygon separated into three classes: 1) the lower extent of data values (dataset-dependent) to -60. These larger, negative BPI values as classed as 'finescale low'; 2) -60 to 60. These data values around zero are classed as 'plane'; 3) 60 to the upper extent of data values (dataset-dependent). These larger, positive BPI values are classed as 'finescale high'.
</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold;">Default values are based on a finescale BPI window size of 27 cells with 5 m DEM (with no smoothing performed) and are intended as a guide.
</p>
<p>Individual datasets should be interrogated to determine the most suitable threshold settings.
</p>

<h3>FineBPI Window Size</h3>
<p>This variable specifies the window size (distance in cells) that is used to calculate finescale BPI.
</p>
<p style="font-style:italic;">For example, a threshold of 27 cells will use a 27 cell-radius (135 m for a 5 m cell DEM) from an individual cell to calculate relative elevation. This 27-cell window will be run across the entire dataset to calculate the relative high, flat and low areas of the dataset at a broad scale.

<p>Size of polygon threshold, <em>i.e.</em> polygons smaller than this will be eliminated. If left blank small polygons will be retained.</p>

<h2>Output</h2>
<h3>Plain Landforms</h3>
<p>A shapefile (surf_elem_plain.shp) containing the plain landforms classification is created in <em>../Working/</em> and subsequently renamed and transfered to the PLAIN_[<em>Region Label</em>] directory.

<h3>Auxillary Outputs</h3>
<p>Also outputs GeoTIFF rasters to <em>../Working/</em> for broadbpi and finebpi. If the <em>Final Landforms</em> shapefile was used then the 'plain_dem' raster is also output.
